	<p> Human Resource interns are responsible for helping onboard new interns, developing policies for the
		internship, and leading discussions on career development. Human Resource interns are the main
		point of information and resources for interns within the DME Team! If you have strong management 
		and writing skills, are outgoing, and have a desire to provide resources and information to help interns
		become professionally developed, Human Resources is the track you should apply for!</p>
