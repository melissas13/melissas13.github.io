	<h1> You Matched With: Photo Finders! </h1>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p> Photo Finder interns are responsible for finding quality, copy-right free images to support
		blog stories, articles, and VA social media channels! Photo Finders have similar skills
		to Research interns since interns need a strong research ability to find appropriate photos.
		On top of that, if you have a love for photos and have a good understanding of copy-right,
		Photo Finders is the internship track you should apply for!</p>
