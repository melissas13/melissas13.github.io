	<h1> You Matched With: External Affairs! </h1>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p> External Affairs interns are responsible for acting as a liason with offices outside of DME. They
		communicate with offices on different kinds of projects, as well as, distribute those projects to various
		interns within all of the internship tracks. They are essentially DME's task managers and provide
		interns with all sorts of new, outside projects. If you are outgoing, organized, and ready to 
		delegate, this is the internship track you should apply for! </p>
