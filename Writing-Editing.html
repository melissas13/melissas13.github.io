	<h1> You Matched With: Writing / Editing </h1>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p> Writing and Editing are two very similar tracks that work together within the DME Team!
		Writing interns focus on writing articles for the VAntage Point blog and writing informational 
		pieces about veteran's / veteran specific content. Editing interns work on the same kinds of 
		projects, but are more focused on reviewing these articles and posts for any errors. If you 
		are a proficient writer or have an eye for catching mistakes, these are the internship tracks 
		you should apply for!</p>
