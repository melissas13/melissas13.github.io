	<h1> You Matched With: Accessibility! </h1>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p> Accessibility interns are in charge of ensuring remediation of all content so that
		Veteran's with disabilities can have acces to the same resources as everyone else. 
		Accessibility interns work on transcriptions, translate alternative text, and a
		variety of other projects. If you are good at writing, have a passion for making sure 
		everyone has equal opportunity, and care about helping/working with others, 
		this is the internship track you should apply for!</p>
